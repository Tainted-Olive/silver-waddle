##If the first divides evenly into the second, tell the user, if not, inform the user.

##Take the below list,

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

##and write a program that prints out all elements of the list that are less than 5.
##Then, Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all
##the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
##Afterwards, Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements
##from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

num = input("Please enter a number:")
flag = 0

for i in a:##for all elements "i" in list "a", if i < num, append.  Very different then looping through.
    if i < int(num):
        b.append(i) ##the list b is an empty list, so using append.(i) adds the current list element to the end of b
